# AIMIDGE

The project idea is a webpage designed for users to generate unique images using artificial intelligence technology. Users will be able to enter text into a specified field, and the system will use a trained artificial intelligence algorithm to create an image corresponding to the input text. The webpage will allow users to manage and edit the generated images, and adjust their resolution. Additionally, registered users will have the option to save and share photos with others, as well as comment pictures. Unregistered users will also be able to generate images, but they will not be able to share or comment on them, and the images of unregistered users will be stored until the end of their session (~20 minutes from the last user interaction with the system). During one session, unregistered users will only be able to generate 3 images. All of this will be available in an interactive and easily navigable interface.



## Main functions

- Session management for unregistered users (images stored for a limited time).
- Limit the number of images unregistered users can generate per session.
