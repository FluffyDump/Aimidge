# AIMIDGE

The project idea is a webpage designed for users to generate unique images using artificial intelligence technology. Users can enter text into a specified field, and the system uses a trained artificial intelligence algorithm to create an image corresponding to the input text. The webpage allows users to generate images from English or Lithuanian text input, download those images, and choose their resolution. Additionally, registered users will have the option to save those images to personal albums, which they can download later on. Unregistered users will also be able to generate images, but they will not be able to save them to personal albums. Unregistered users will only be able to generate 3 images during one session.
